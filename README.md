# project-calculator
The Odin Project assignment.

Version History:

v0.4

- Added classes and ids to HTML Elements.
- Added event handlers for button clicks and keyboard presses.
- Added text formatting and restricted commas on numbers that already have one.


What's next:

- Work on the evaluation function.

Future plans:

- Support for trigonometric operations.
- GUI overhaul

Known bugs:

- Pressing space adds a whitespace when it should be ignored. I can't understand
  why this is happening and restricting the event listener doesn't seem to work.
  It's not a terrible bug, but it can potentially break the calculations.
